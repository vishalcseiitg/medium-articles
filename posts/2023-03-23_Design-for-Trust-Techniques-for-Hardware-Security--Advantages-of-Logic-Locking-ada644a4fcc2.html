However, this globalization of the IC supply chain has led to security vulnerabilities such as IP piracy, overbuilding, counterfeiting, reverse engineering, and the insertion of hardware Trojans.</p><p name="d1d8" id="d1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Various countermeasures have been developed to address these security threats, including watermarking, split manufacturing, camouflaging, hardware metering, and logic locking. Logic locking has emerged as a promising solution that can be easily integrated into the conventional IC design/fabrication process. In recent years, logic locking has garnered increasing interest from the research community, with the development of different defenses and attacks leading to ever-stronger defenses. However, to attract practitioners to the field of logic locking and hardware security, there is a need to convey the fundamental principles in a pedagogical manner. This article will provide an introduction to logic locking and its potential as a versatile and effective defense against IC supply chain security threats.</p><blockquote name="9d7f" id="9d7f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Traditional IC Design Flow</blockquote><p name="c76f" id="c76f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Figure 1.1 illustrates the typical steps involved in the conventional integrated circuit (IC) design flow. The design process begins with the definition of system specifications, which are then translated into a netlist consisting of interconnected logic gates through a series of logic design steps. Each gate in the netlist represents a Boolean function.</p><p name="c9fe" id="c9fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The gate-level netlist is then subjected to a series of physical design steps to map all the gates and interconnects to a geometric representation of transistors and wires, known as a layout. This layout is then sent to a foundry, where a set of masks is created for the photolithography of silicon wafers, leading to the fabrication of the ICs.</p><figure name="a19f" id="a19f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*q2yG4I0L3-SwkbzSgh1n5w.png" data-width="536" data-height="554" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*q2yG4I0L3-SwkbzSgh1n5w.png"></figure><p name="10c0" id="10c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The fabricated ICs are tested for manufacturing defects, and those that pass the manufacturing test are deemed functional ICs. These ICs are then distributed to end-users for deployment in various electronic systems.</p><p name="8899" id="8899" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Historically, leading semiconductor companies such as Intel and IBM have followed a vertically integrated business model. They owned their foundries and designed, fabricated, and tested ICs in-house in secure environments.</p><blockquote name="cec2" id="cec2" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Globalized IC Design Flow</blockquote><p name="35e8" id="35e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The increasing complexity of ICs, the need for faster time-to-market, and the rising costs of building and maintaining semiconductor foundries have led to the globalization of IC design flow. Many semiconductor companies, such as Apple, have adopted a fabless business model where they outsource the fabrication of ICs to offshore foundries, such as TSMC in Taiwan. Additionally, outsourced assemblies and test (OSAT) companies, like ASE and Amkor, may handle the testing, assembly, or packaging of the ICs.</p><p name="dd02" id="dd02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To reduce design effort and meet strict time-to-market requirements, design houses may also purchase and incorporate third-party intellectual property (3PIP) cores in their designs. This further increases the number of entities involved in the IC design and deployment process, with multiple companies from different parts of the world handling different processing steps. Figure 1.1 illustrates the differences between the traditional and globalized IC design flows, with red circles highlighting the entities handling outsourced services.</p><p name="1178" id="1178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The globalized IC design flow also introduces new threats, as ICs are susceptible to various security risks. The distributed nature of the IC design flow means that ICs can be compromised at any point in the supply chain, from the 3PIP vendors to the foundries and OSAT companies. Thus, it is crucial to have robust security measures in place to protect against these threats.</p><blockquote name="dfee" id="dfee" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The Emergence of Hardware Security Vulnerabilities</blockquote><p name="bf14" id="bf14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In a globalized and distributed IC supply chain, various potentially untrusted agents may have access to valuable soft IP or physical ICs. This increased access to critical assets creates opportunities for rogue elements to exploit valuable information and jeopardize the trust in the IC design flow. Figure 1.2 illustrates the threats associated with the main entities in the IC design flow.</p><p name="f14d" id="f14d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 3PIP vendors, who provide pre-designed IP cores for integration into IC designs, may be susceptible to malicious activities, such as introducing backdoors or Trojan horses into their IP cores, stealing or leaking IP, or modifying the IP to introduce vulnerabilities.</p><figure name="1e5e" id="1e5e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Jx4KH_SzIj9CmbRLFOIu0w.png" data-width="448" data-height="608" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Jx4KH_SzIj9CmbRLFOIu0w.png"></figure><p name="ca67" id="ca67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The SoC integrators, who assemble the IP cores into a complete IC design, may be vulnerable to attacks on their design environment, including theft of design data or unauthorized modifications to the design.</p><p name="655c" id="655c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The foundries that fabricate the ICs based on the design specifications may be at risk of attacks that manipulate the IC layout or introduce malicious modifications during the fabrication process.</p><p name="4a60" id="4a60" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finally, the OSAT companies, who test, package, and ship the ICs to customers, may be vulnerable to attacks that modify or compromise the functionality of the ICs or steal or tamper with the sensitive data stored in the ICs.</p><blockquote name="77b1" id="77b1" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">The distributed nature of the IC design flow creates multiple potential attack surfaces, and effective security measures must be implemented at each stage to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the ICs.</blockquote><p name="ab1a" id="ab1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The globalization and distribution of the IC design flow have increased the risk of threats to the valuable soft IP or the physical IC. In particular, IP piracy, overbuilding, and hardware Trojans are significant threats that may compromise the integrity and security of the IC design flow. IP piracy involves the illegal use or distribution of intellectual property, such as netlist or layout files, which can be stolen by an attacker in a design house and sold as genuine. The semiconductor industry incurs losses of over $4 billion annually due to IP infringement.</p><p name="cd94" id="cd94" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Overbuilding is another form of piracy that can occur at an untrusted foundry. A rogue foundry may overproduce extra ICs from the same set of masks and sell them illegally at a cheaper price than the original IC company, thereby increasing the costs for the company only marginally.</p><p name="f0df" id="f0df" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Hardware Trojans are small, hard-to-detect circuitry that malicious agents can insert in an IC to reveal secret information or cause service disruption at a specific moment during the IC operation. The presence of Trojans is challenging to verify and test, especially when no golden (Trojan-free) reference is available to compare against. Suspected sources of Trojans include 3PIP used in the design or mask alteration during fabrication. These threats highlight the importance of ensuring the security and integrity of the IC design flow in a globalized and distributed supply chain.</p><blockquote name="043b" id="043b" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Counterfeiting and reverse engineering</blockquote><p name="a73f" id="a73f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Counterfeiting and reverse engineering are also two major threats to the semiconductor industry. Counterfeit ICs, fraudulent replicas of genuine ICs, represent more than 5% of all commercial ICs and can pose serious reliability and security concerns. In fact, the top five counterfeited semiconductor components represent a revenue risk of up to $169 billion, according to a 2012 IHS report. On the other hand, reverse engineering involves extracting an IC&#39;s design and technology details using imaging techniques. While reverse engineering can be used for benign purposes, such as checking for IP rights infringement, it can also enable hardware-based attacks, such as IP piracy, counterfeiting, and insertion of hardware Trojans. Attackers may exploit reverse engineering to identify stealthy locations for inserting Trojans or extracting secret information such as cryptographic keys. With the globalized IC design flow, solutions are urgently needed to protect ICs and electronic systems against these threats.</p><blockquote name="59c1" id="59c1" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Design-for-Trust (DfTr) Solutions</blockquote><p name="f582" id="f582" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">To address the threats of IP piracy, reverse engineering, and other hardware-based attacks, several design-for-trust (DfTr) techniques have been proposed. These include <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">watermarking, fingerprinting, metering, camouflaging, split manufacturing, and logic locking</em></strong>.</p><p name="2a50" id="2a50" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Watermarking and fingerprinting are <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">passive</em> techniques that embed signatures into the design to help detect piracy but do not prevent it.</p><figure name="9668" id="9668" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*BmUfY9ns7yskF-KTHWtfMQ.png" data-width="334" data-height="442" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*BmUfY9ns7yskF-KTHWtfMQ.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">The layout of typical 2-input (a) NAND and (b) NOR gates. The metal layers look different from the top, and it is easy to distinguish by visual inspection. The camouflaged layout of 2-input (c)NAND and (d) NOR gates. The metal layers are identical, and the two gates cannot be distinguished from the top view.</figcaption></figure><p name="00ff" id="00ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Camouflaging, on the other hand, aims to prevent reverse engineering by replacing selected gates in a design with their camouflaged counterparts, making it difficult for an attacker to determine the true functionality of the gates. Camouflaging is a layout-level technique that requires the support of a trusted foundry.</p><p name="0ad6" id="0ad6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Split manufacturing involves splitting the design into two parts, manufactured in separate foundries and ultimately stacked together. Split manufacturing is also a layout-level technique that can prevent piracy by an untrusted foundry. To protect against these threats, DfTr solutions are needed in the IC design process.</p><blockquote name="6c81" id="6c81" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Metering</blockquote><p name="7f86" id="7f86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Metering is a technique that involves assigning a unique identifier to each manufactured IC and helps in tracking individual ICs after manufacturing. There are two types of metering techniques: passive and active. Passive metering techniques are used to identify piracy, while active metering techniques allow the IC owner to monitor and control the behavior of the IC during in-field operation.</p><blockquote name="2d20" id="2d20" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Logic Locking: An Overview</blockquote><p name="5fd6" id="5fd6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Logic locking is a powerful defense against threats such as piracy, overbuilding, and reverse engineering attacks by rogue entities at any subsequent stage in the IC design flow. This technique inserts additional logic into a design that locks it with a secret key. The design becomes functional only upon unlocking/activation with the correct key. The output of a locked circuit is a function of both the primary and the additional key inputs, and applying an incorrect key to the design results in an incorrect output. Compared to other DfTr techniques, logic locking offers the most versatile protection and assumes only the design house to be trusted. It can be integrated with metering techniques to assign a unique key to each fabricated IC, further enhancing its security. This section will provide a high-level comparison of logic locking with other DfTr techniques.</p><blockquote name="9103" id="9103" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Logic Locking vs. Other DfTr Techniques</blockquote><p name="cfda" id="cfda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The techniques used in Design-for-Trust (DfTr) differ mainly in the threat model and security objectives they offer. Passive techniques like watermarking and fingerprinting can only detect piracy after it has occurred. In contrast, layout-level techniques like camouflaging and split manufacturing offer protection only after the design has been laid out. Camouflaging requires a trusted foundry for manufacturing the camouflaged gates, protecting only against untrusted end-users. Split manufacturing aims to protect against an untrusted foundry, protecting only against piracy by a single entity. On the other hand, logic locking offers the most versatile protection among all DfTr techniques. It can protect against piracy, overbuilding, and reverse engineering attacks by rogue entities at any stage in the IC design flow except for the trusted design house.</p><blockquote name="f946" id="f946" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Logic Locking: Definitions and Terminology</blockquote><p name="e061" id="e061" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Logic locking is a highly effective DfTr technique that protects ICs against reverse engineering-based piracy. This is achieved by inserting additional logic into a circuit and locking the original design with a secret key, which can only be unlocked with the correct key value. The additional logic consists of combinational or sequential logic, and the protection properties are determined by the type of protection logic employed. Key inputs are driven by an on-chip tamper-proof memory, and the circuit produces the correct output only upon application of the correct key value.</p><blockquote name="7a4f" id="7a4f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">IC Design Flow with Logic Locking</blockquote><p name="57fe" id="57fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Figure 1.6 depicts the IC design flow that involves logic locking to protect an IC&#39;s intellectual property (IP). The original netlist of the IC is locked with a secret key value that is only known to the IP owner. The locked netlist then passes through several untrusted design stages, including an untrusted foundry and an outsourced test facility. The key inputs of the locked circuit are driven by an on-chip tamper-proof memory, which ensures that the design remains locked until the correct key is loaded into it. An attacker can only recover the original functionality of the design by knowing the correct key value. The IP owner can activate the fabricated IC by loading the secret key to the tamper-proof memory in trusted settings.</p><figure name="bea6" id="bea6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*Klp02vixFgYRaZ-VThdPxA.png" data-width="458" data-height="556" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Klp02vixFgYRaZ-VThdPxA.png"></figure><blockquote name="e0b0" id="e0b0" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--figure">Conclusion</blockquote><p name="3b99" id="3b99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing">This chapter has provided a comprehensive overview of hardware security threats and how they can be mitigated through various Design-for-Trust (DfTr) techniques. The advantages of logic locking over other DfTr techniques and its effectiveness in preventing hardware-based attacks were also discussed. Logic locking is a powerful technique that helps to safeguard intellectual property and prevent hardware piracy. Logic locking can thwart reverse engineering attempts and protect against malicious modifications by encrypting the design. With the increasing complexity of hardware designs and the growing threat of hardware attacks, it is important to consider DfTr techniques such as logic locking to ensure the security and integrity of hardware systems.</p></div></div></section><section name="3784" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><blockquote name="595f" id="595f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf--leading">References:</blockquote><figure name="1616" id="1616" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--pullquote graf--trailing"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*oPtwBuK3vlkexY_Atc6ZGA.png" data-width="400" data-height="600" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oPtwBuK3vlkexY_Atc6ZGA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Trustworthy Hardware Design: Combinational Logic Locking Techniques</figcaption></figure></div></div></section>
